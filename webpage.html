<h2>
  Trek's Full Aero Assault
</h2>


<p>
  The new 2016 Trek Madone is back and better than ever. Featuring aero tube shaping, an isospeed decoupler and other features to make it a powerful race machine.
The new model year for the Madone brought about plenty of changes. The new tube shaping out of the 600 Series OCLV carbon fiber is strong, compliant and very aerodynamic, giving you the speed and perofrmance you expect out of Trek. Integtration is also huge, brakes, cables and more are tucked away giving the Madone a sleek look and additional aero quaities.
